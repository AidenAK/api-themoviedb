The Movie DB API
================

Author: Stuart Boston (Omertron AT Gmail DOT com)

This API uses the TheMovieDB.org API as specified here http://api.themoviedb.org/

Originally written for use by YetAnotherMovieJukebox (YAMJ) http://code.google.com/p/moviejukebox/
But anyone can feel free to use it for other projects as well.

TheMovieDB.org is an excellent open database for movie and film content. I encourage you to check it out and contribute to keep it growing.
