The Movie DB API
================

Author: Stuart Boston (Omertron AT Gmail DOT com)

This API uses the [TheMovieDB.org API](http://api.themoviedb.org/)

Originally written for use by Yet Another Movie Jukebox [(YAMJ)](http://code.google.com/p/moviejukebox/)

But anyone can use it for other projects as well.

TMDB TV Support
===============

Release 4.0 of the API now includes TV shows.

This has resulted in a complete re-write of the API and many of the methods and models have been re-written to support the new TV calls.

### TheMovieDB.org
This is an excellent open database for movie and film content.

I *strongly* encourage you to check it out and contribute to keep it growing.
